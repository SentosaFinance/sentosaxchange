# Add a Currency

Instructions for getting a new cryptocurrency added to SentosaXchange.

## Requirements

- The currency must be [Bitcoin-compatible](https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/get-listed-barterDEX.html) or ERC20-based.
- If the currency is not ERC20-based, there must be at least 2 trusted Electrum servers for the currency. The servers should available on domains/subdomains, not IP addresses. Preferably subdomains on the official domain. Say the domain is `currency.com`, the Electrum servers should be at `electrum1.currency.com` and `electrum2.currency.com`. You also need to commit to keeping the Electrum servers running, and if they need to be taken down, give us due notice to make changes.

## Proof

You must prove to us that the currency information is correct and that the Electrum servers are officially approved.
